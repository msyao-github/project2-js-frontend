# HamEdit Up

**HamEdit Up** is a single-page-app that allows logged in users to create, edit and delete their own article posts.

1. Users can view articles after clicking Articles tab
2. Users can register, log in, change password and log out
3. Users can create, edit and edit their own articles, which will display with all the articles

### Approach

I used bootstrap, handlebars, Ruby on Rails and javascript to build this app.


### Next Steps

- Create admin user to edit and delete any user's articles
- Use handlebars to prefill fields when user click to edit content
- Be able to display all articles and filter for the user's own contributions
- Give users ability to comment on articles
- Use [Paperclip](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3) Rails gem to implement file attachement functionality for users to upload images
